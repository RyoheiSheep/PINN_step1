```

## üéØ Key Insights

### Automatic Weight Adaptation
The gradient norm weighting shows dramatic weight changes:
- **Physics terms** (ru, rv, rc): Weights ~0.5 (reduced emphasis)
- **Boundary terms** (u_bc, v_bc): Weights ~100,000 (increased emphasis)

This happens because:
1. Physics losses start much larger than boundary losses
2. Gradient norm weighting detects this imbalance
3. Weights automatically adjust to balance gradient magnitudes
4. Result: All loss terms contribute equally to optimization

### Performance Benefits
1. **Better Convergence**: Automatic balancing often leads to better final solutions
2. **Robustness**: Works across different problem scales and Reynolds numbers
3. **No Tuning**: Eliminates manual weight search process
4. **Research Ready**: Provides insights into training dynamics

## üîß Integration with Existing Code

### Modify Your Training Script
```python
# Replace this:
config.weighting.scheme = "fixed"
config.physics.loss_weights = {"boundary": 10.0, ...}  # Manual tuning

# With this:
config.weighting.scheme = "grad_norm"
config.weighting.grad_norm = {"update_every": 100}
# No manual tuning needed!
```

### Monitor Weight Evolution
```python
# During training, access adaptive weights:
loss_dict = trainer.train_step()
current_weights = {
    'physics': loss_dict.get('weight_ru', 1.0),
    'boundary': loss_dict.get('weight_u_bc', 1.0)
}
print(f"Current adaptive weights: {current_weights}")
```

## üìà Visualization Features

All implementations include comprehensive visualizations:

1. **Loss Evolution**: Total and component losses over time
2. **Weight Evolution**: How adaptive weights change (grad norm only)
3. **Loss Balance**: Ratio analysis showing automatic balancing
4. **Solution Visualization**: Final velocity field and flow patterns
5. **Performance Metrics**: Convergence rates and training efficiency
